## Todo

Redo built in default commands with more checks.

- custom commands should not be able to contain the same name as a default commands by the bot.
- custom commands should be message based only, not slash. (slash commands are not supported by the bot yet)
- toggle-command command should not be able to disable itself. (this is a bug).
- Use collections and not Map.

Fix typings on classes for better intellisense.

Make class methods public so they can be accessed easier through out the bot code.
